# moodle-block_snap
A block for Moodle that takes all the activities and resources in the intro section of a course and turns them into a navigation menu on the side. The intro section is then hidden. Using Javascript, it will hide all the different topics and create a navigation bar at the top of the course with numbered circles. This brings the topics and/or weeks to the top.
